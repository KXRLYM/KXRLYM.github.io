Hi there, my name is Karlym and welcome to my space. 


When I was in high school, I wanted to get a PhD in astrophysics. But I ended up taking mechatronics engineering!

I still love physics, Earth, most of things on Earth including seafood, marine animals, big ragged mountain ranges and coastlines.

I want to deploy underwater or space robots for scientific exploration and removing humans from dangerous worksplaces.

I would love to be a part of community sharing ROS2 struggles and building cool drones from scratch for aerial photography.

You can find any projects that I have been involved in and any technical details about them here!
